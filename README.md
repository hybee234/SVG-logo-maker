## User Acceptance Criteria <a ID="user-acceptance-criteria"></a>

### This application was developed with the below User acceptance criteria:

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters

WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square

WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300 (w) x 200 (h) pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

```
### Additional requirements:
```
- Develop tests to validate rendering of shapes (circle, square, triangle)
- Produce a walkthrough video demonstrating functionality of the application and tests
```

## Testing

Test scripts have been developed to validate the SVG Output from Circle.js, Square.js and Triangle.js.

Run the below command in CLI to initiate testing via Jest

```
npm run test
```

### Additional Testing

* Validate that when you run ``` node index.js ``` in CLI that you are presented with a series of questions to answer
* Validate that when responding to shape colour and text colour in keyword format, that the application checks to ensure the reponse matches supported colours <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#ColorKeywords">Link here </a>
* Validate that when responding to shape colour and text colour in hexadecimal format, that the application checks to ensure the response is in format #ABC123 (the six characters following the # can be any from A-F and digit from 0-9. There must also be six characters following the '#')
* Validate that the responding to the text to appear on the logo, that there is a 3 character limit.
* Validate that when the questions have all been answered, that a `logo.svg` file is generated in the `output` subfolder

* Validate that when running 'jest' tests, that the tests all successfully pass
